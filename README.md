# Chock-A-Block

A new take on the world famous puzzle game

# How to play

After tapping 'Quick game', you will be met with your automatically generated randomized puzzle: a 5 x 11 grid on which you must place polyomino 'blocks' to fill every cell.
The first block will be placed for you - your task is to place the rest! So start rotating, flipping, and dragging & dropping - when every square is filled and every piece is used: You Win!
